\section*{Jetan Quiescence Search (50 Points)}

Quiescence search is an extension of search used
when the cut-off depth has been reached, but the board
is in a turbulent state.  We'll define turbulent to
be if either princess is under attack. Because it may
take many levels for the princess attack to be resolved,
we don't want it to go on for unlimited levels.  So, we'll
implement the quiescence search with a depth limit of
its own.
  
\subsection*{Task}

In the alpha-beta search agent, add a pair of Min/Max
methods to be used for quiescence search.  The cut-off
for these will be if the game is over, or the board
has become quiet (princess no longer under attack), or
if the quiescence depth has been reached.

The normal Min/Max methods will need to be modified to
call the correct quiescence method if the board is
not quiet when max depth is reached.

Run your agent against itself.  One instance with quiescence
search and one without.  Use the same max depth for both,
and give a quiescence depth of 2 for the quiescence agent.
Play at least 4 games (2 in each direction).

Write a brief report on the results.  Include instructions
for using quiescence search with your agent in the report.
Submit the report to Canvas.

Be sure to push your code to github.
