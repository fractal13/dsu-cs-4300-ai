\section*{Rubik's Dot Goal (50 Points)}

One of the interesting patterns for a Rubik's cube is the four dot pattern.
It looks like this in the T-view.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    www
    www
    www
bbb ooo ggg rrr
bgb oro gbg ror
bbb ooo ggg rrr
    yyy
    yyy
    yyy
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection*{Task}

Create a rubiks command script that will solve any cube
to this state.  This is like the final script you built
for the homework, only the final goal is different.

Use your script to solve the cubes given to that state.
Find \texttt{DotCubes.txt} in the exam files. 
Write a brief report with the commands needed to solve
each one.  These should be written in a format like this:

\begin{verbatim}
init cube the cube to be solved
rotate L R' ... the commands to solve the cube.
\end{verbatim}

Include the location of this script in the report.
Submit the report to the Canvas task.

Be sure that your script is pushed to github.
