\begin{problem}{25}

  We discussed adding risk to the Wumpus agent by
  allowing it to take a calculated risk when a cell's
  probability of containing a pit was low enough.
  If you implemented probability risk in your solution,
  then this problem is for you.  If you didn't already
  implement it, you probably don't want to take the time
  now.

  \textbf{Task}
  
  Run your agent with risk taking disabled, on a set of
  100 (or more) worlds, with the world sizes varying from
  3 to 5 in each dimension.  Use a pit probability of 0.2.
  Collect data on the number of deaths, golds, and score.
  Repeat with the same world parameters, including random number seed,
  with risk taking turned on.  Collect the same data.
  Repeat both runs again, but with pit probability of 0.1, collecting data.

  Now you have 4 sets of data to compare for risk taking vs. non-risk taking.
  Create a short report with this data, and your interpretation of the
  results.  Submit the report to the Canvas task.
