Rubik's Dot Goal
---------------------------

## Description

In addition to the solved rubik's cube, some people enjoy making
patterns on the cube faces. 
[This site](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/rubiks-cube-patterns-algorithms/)
has a collection of interesting patterns, and algorithms for making them
from solved cubes.

One of the interesting patterns for a Rubik's cube is the four dot pattern.
It looks like this in the T-view.

        www
        www
        www
    bbb ooo ggg rrr
    bgb oro gbg ror
    bbb ooo ggg rrr
        yyy
        yyy
        yyy

## Task

Create a rubiks command script that will solve any cube
to this state.  This is like the final script you built
for the homework, only the final goal is different.

Use your script to solve the sample cubes from the
homework assignment to the four dot pattern.


Pass-off

## Report

In the exam report, record the expected performance measure of this script 
with these final goals.  Assume the same performance measure as the assignment.

## Source 

Store the location of your dot solving script in
`cs4300-code-ai-agents/prog/RubiksCube/dot_solver_location.txt`.

Be sure that your script and this file are committed and pushed to github.
