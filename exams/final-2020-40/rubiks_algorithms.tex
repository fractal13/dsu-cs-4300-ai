\begin{problem}{50}

  Somebody has to discover the algorithms for humans to
  memorize when solving the Rubik's cube.  In this
  task, you will find a shortest path from one state
  to another for several interesting cases.

  \vspace{.1in}
  \textbf{Task}

  For each of the pairs of cube states, use A* search
  to find the shortest path between them.

  Create a command script to use in finding the shortest
  paths.
  
  Create a brief report with the algorithms found
  for each pair of cubes.  Include the location of the 
  script in the report. Submit the report to the Canvas task.

  Be sure that your script is pushed to github.
