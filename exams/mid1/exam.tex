Scenario 1

The intersection of University Avenue and St. George Boulevard handles a lot of traffic,
both vehicles and pedestrians.  Traffic lights, including crosswalk lights, control the flow of traffic.
There are crosswalks for all four crossing directions.  Our agent is located on the
south-east corner of the intersection and needs to reach the north-west corner.  The
agent has audio and visual sensors, and motion actuators that allow the agent to move
forward and rotate to change direction.



Scenario 2

The puzzle below is a variation of slider puzzles.  Legal moves are made
by sliding a piece into an unoccupied area.  Each slide is a separate
move.  In this puzzle, the pieces have a variety of shapes.  The goal
is to move the big red piece to the bottom of the box next to the
red line on the border.  Our agent has an arm that can reach out
and slide a piece in the desired direction.  Due to the arm's construction,
and the friction of the pieces against the board, sometimes the
arm tries to move the wrong piece, or the piece doesn't slide.
The agent also has a vision system capable of recognizing the
locations of all of the pieces.
