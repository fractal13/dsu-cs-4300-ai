I'm leading an undergraduate course, CS 4300. It's current title is "Artificial Intelligence". I'm moving it's title to "Intelligent Agents".
The course has been based on "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. For this undergraduate course,
I have spend time with the introduction material, search, a little bit of logic, and some techniques for handling uncertainty.

This project is to help me generate updated course materials, that will restructure the course material. I'll still cover most of the same topics,
but Agentic-AI techniques with Language Models will be introduced and expanded to about 50% of the course material.
