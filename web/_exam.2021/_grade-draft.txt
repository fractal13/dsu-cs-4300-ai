Jessica Kelly Cserepes Team-Draft

No work during the exam.


Samantha A Esplin Team-Draft
-----------------

Only 1 tournament's teams displayed in PIKACHU.txt.
Utility scores are a little lower than expected.


LangHui HE Team-Draft
----------

I don't see the utility scores in PIKACHU.txt
After running your program, the utility scores are not believable.


Slade William Hirschi Team-Draft
---------------------

I'm not seeing teams grouped or utility scores for them in PIKACHU.txt.

            if score > bestScore and score < bestScore:
                # This ^^^^^^^^^ looks wrong.
                secondBestScore = score


Melanie K Lent Team-Draft
--------------

Team scores are not very good.


Jason David Loosle Team-Draft
------------------

Why do your code and Derek's code share character-wise duplications?
I see that both the assignment utility and the exam utility implementations are missing the
min(score vs opponent pokemons) element.

Good job.


Micah Brian Morgan Team-Draft

            best = (currentDCOST[1] + currentDCOST[0]) / 2
            if best < worstScore:
                worstScore = currentDCOST[1]
                # Shouldn't this be worstScore = best?


Travis Morwood Team-Draft

The utility function is missing the min(all enemy scores) piece.
"For each pokemon allowed in the tournament, find the two team member
 pokemon with the best scores vs the tournament pokemon. Take the
 average of these scores. This is the team’s score vs that one pokemon.
 Find the minimum of these scores. That is the team’s utility."
Most likely the overflow problem is from the math.exp() function when
the temperature gets too small.


Dawson P Nielson Team-Draft

Team scores are *very* high.  Unbelievably high.
The utility function is missing the min(all enemy scores) piece.
"For each pokemon allowed in the tournament, find the two team member
 pokemon with the best scores vs the tournament pokemon. Take the
 average of these scores. This is the team’s score vs that one pokemon.
 Find the minimum of these scores. That is the team’s utility."
 

Hunter D. Nielson Team-Draft
-----------------

I don't understand how the utility scores are working.  There is no
/2 in the exam utility function, yet the scores are in the mid-low
500s.


Marcos Ramos-Gutierrez Team-Draft
----------------------

Only 1 tournament's teams are in the PIKACHU.txt file.



Derek Burch Sneddon Team-Draft
-------------------

I see that both the assignment utility and the exam utility implementations are missing the
min(score vs opponent pokemons) element.  That explains the exceptionally high scores
found.
Why do your code and Jason's code share character-wise duplications?


Taft Allan Thompson Team-Draft
-------------------

Good job.

Rebecca Winn Team-Draft
-------------

Only 1 tournament's teams were saved in PIKACHU.txt.
Utility scores appear to just be the max value, not the average to the 2 best values.
The utilities in PIKACHU.txt are not very good, given the utility function used.
