agent such that:

- Your agent will use a variation of local search or classic search.
- You may have to manually choose whether your agent uses local or classic search.
- Your agent will run for not more than 120 seconds per problem.
- Your agent will display the pieces of the solved puzzle in the index order discussed in the homework.
- Your agent can solve puzzles with 3 or 4 rows.


Task Requirements
-----------------

## Requirement 1

Use your agent to find solutions to the 5 triangle puzzles given for
the exam data set. Each puzzle has a solution.

## Requirement 2

Create a file `BILL.txt` in the root of your repository with the
solutions found to each puzzle.  Also include
clear instructions how I would run your solver to get similar
results.

## Requirement 3

Add, commit, and push your changes.  This includes the `BILL.txt`
file and all of the exam puzzles.
