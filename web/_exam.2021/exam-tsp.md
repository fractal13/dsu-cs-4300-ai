TSP
------------

In the traveling salesman problem assignment, you created a program to
find low-cost cycles through a collection of cities.

Assumptions
----------------

As a result of your work on this project you have an
agent such that:

- Your agent will use a variation of local search.
- Your agent will run for not more than 120 seconds per problem.
- Your agent will display the cost of the best cycle found, and the order to visit the cities.


Task Requirements
-----------------

## Requirement 1

Use your agent to find low cost cycles for each of the collections in
the exam data set.  Each collection has a best cycle cost less than 5000.

## Requirement 2

Create a file `FRODO.txt` in the root of your repository with the
solutions found to each of the collections.  Also include
clear instructions how I would run your solver to get similar
results.

## Requirement 3

Add, commit, and push your changes.  This includes the `FRODO.txt`
file and all of the exam collections of cities.

Additional Information
----------------------

The files are named `exam-cities/middle-earth20_name.txt` and `exam-cities/middle-earth20_dist.txt`
where `20` is the number of cities.  There are 5 different collections.
You can [download the data](exam-cities.zip).


Pass Off Procedure
------------------

- Create the `FRODO.txt` file mentioned above.
- Add, commit, and push your changes to the repository.
- After the exam, your solutions will be checked.
- After the exam, your solver will be used on similar problems.
