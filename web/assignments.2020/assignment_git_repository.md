CS 4300: Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

Assignment: Git Repository
-----------------------------------

Create your starter repository using the link available in Canvas.

Clone the repository, and build the project using `make`.  Look at `README.md` for 
a few more details on building.

In the `cs4300-code-ai/bin/00bin-o` directory, run `RectangleSolver`.
Use this tool to find a solution to each of the allowable sizes of rectangles.
For each of the solutions, record the solution found, the number of nodes
generated during the search, and the maximum frontier size.

Create a report. The report should include 

- the configurations used in the tool,  (`show config`)
- the solution found for each rectangle size, (a simple text display would be great)
- a table showing the number of nodes generated and maximum frontier size for each search. 

An example of using the RectangleSolver can be seen in 
`cs4300-code-ai-agents/prog/Rectangle/SampleInput.cmd`
