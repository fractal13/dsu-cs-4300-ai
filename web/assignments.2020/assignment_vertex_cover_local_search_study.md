Assignment: Vertex Cover Local Search Study
------------------------------------------------

This assignment is a followup to the previous assignment.

Requirements
------------

- Use the tuning settings from the previous assignments,
  including the objective function, restart and generation limits,
  and simulated annealing temperature parameters.
- Generate a complexity chart showing how many states are generated
  in solving problems of size N for each of the 3 search algorithms.
- Generate a quality chart showing the quality of solution
  in solving problems of size N for each of the 3 search algorithms.
- Add these charts to the documentation from the previous assignment.
