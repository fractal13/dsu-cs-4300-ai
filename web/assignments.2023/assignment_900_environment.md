Assignment: Environment Abstraction and Simplification
------------------------------------------------------

Create a PEAS assessment for one environment. This assessment
will need to be as specific and detailed as possible, about a
simplified and abstracted environment. Ideally,
this assessment will provide all of the information necessary
to implement an environment simulator.

You may select an environment from any of those previously assessed by 
yourself or your classmates.  If you use a classmate's environment,
acknowledge them in your report, and request their assessment document
from the previous assignment.
If a classmate chooses one of your environments, please be gracious and 
share your PEAS assessment from the previous assignment.

Where possible, abstract and simplify ideas from the original environment.
For example, if your idea is a real time strategy game, where
there are dozens of units and buildings for each civilization, 
then, reduce to one civilization, keep only one type of worker, one type
of fighter, one type of building, and one type of resource.
You will still have some core interactions of the game, but fewer of the
nuances of the game.

By abstracting and simplifying, you will make it possible to be detailed
and specific about the remaining elements of the environment.
Detailed and specific means that there should not be any information
left as assumptions, or to be looked up later when implementing the code
for the environment simulator.

The Known/Unknown section of your assessment should include mathematical
formulas and algorithms (*not* code, algorithms) that will be used
to implement the physics of the environment.
