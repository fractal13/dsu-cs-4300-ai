CS 4300: Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

Assignment: Project Presentation
------------------------------------------------------

Prepare slides for a 4 minute presentation. Present your project and its results
using these slides during the randomly assigned class period, beginning on the
due date. Think of this as an oral
report to your classmates on your project. You should practice your presentation
to be sure that it fits into the required time limitation. 

If you don't have enough material for 4 minutes, maybe you are skipping over
some detail of your project that may be interesting.

If you take more than 4 minutes to present your project, maybe you're over 
sharing some part of the project. Try to simplify and summarize.



Possible Outline for the Presentation
--------------------------------------

- Introduce PEAS assessment of your project.
- Describe the agent you have built for the environment. Include any variations of the agent.
- Describe the variety of problem instances.
- Show the results of the agent's performance.
- Discuss possible changes and improvements that could be made to the project.

DO NOT GO ON-AND-ON ABOUT WHAT DIDN'T WORK, or WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO.
