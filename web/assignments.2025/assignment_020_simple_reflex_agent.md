CS 4300: Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

Assignment: Simple Reflex Agent
------------------------------------------------------

Create at least 3 variations of a simple reflex agent to 
play [Lunar Lander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).

The performance measure used by this assignment to rank your agents
will be the total reward received from the environment.

Use the GitHub repository available for this course to store your
solutions.  Make a directory named `lunar-reflex`, and store
your agents in `lunar-reflex/agent1.py`, `lunar-reflex/agent2.py`, and `lunar-reflex/agent3.py`.

Note that you are to implement *SIMPLE REFLEX* agents. DO NOT make a
reinforcement learning agent, or use some other algorithms for these
agents.

Create a short report, describing the reflexes built into your best agent.
Provide a table of the average performance of your 3 agents over 50
plays of the game.

Required Submissions
------------------------

- Code submitted to github.
- A PDF file containing your report submitted to Canvas.
