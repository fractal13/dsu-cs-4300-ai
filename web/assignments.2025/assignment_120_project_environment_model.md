CS 4300: Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

Assignment: Model, Environment, Random Agent Implementation
------------------------------------------------------

Complete an implementation of the model for your environment.
Use that model to create either a `gymnasium`(single agent) or 
`pettingzoo`(multi-agent) environment. Create a random agent
implementation for your environment. Test the model and environment.

The environment implementation must follow the example structure
provided in class examples. Inside the `project` folder of
your repository, create a `dash-seperated-name-environment` folder that
contains the environment package. This is equivalent in structure
to the `uniform-coins-environment` or `rock-paper-scissors-environment` 
folder from the examples.
