Something must be wrong with the utility function.  Some of
the cycle costs are too low.
        cost *= -1
Is indented too far.

Lance Condie TSP

The utility function must be broken.  There are not cycles
with costs below 4500.  Looks like it's not considering
closing the cycle.

Slade William Hirschi TSP
---------------------

The model is not storing the full matrix of edge costs.
There is no randomness to the restarts, so you will get the
same starting point every hillClimb().


Slade William Hirschi Team-Draft
---------------------

I'm not seeing teams grouped or utility scores for them in PIKACHU.txt.

            if score > bestScore and score < bestScore:
                # This ^^^^^^^^^ looks wrong.
                secondBestScore = score

You could have printed the results from your program, then copy/pasted it into the BILL.txt

Why do your code and Derek's code share character-wise duplications?
I see that both the assignment utility and the exam utility implementations are missing the
min(score vs opponent pokemons) element.

Travis Morwood TSP

You really should use a main() function to control programs.
Cycle costs not displayed.

Travis Morwood Team-Draft
--------------

The utility function is missing the min(all enemy scores) piece.
"For each pokemon allowed in the tournament, find the two team member
 pokemon with the best scores vs the tournament pokemon. Take the
 average of these scores. This is the team’s score vs that one pokemon.
 Find the minimum of these scores. That is the team’s utility."
Most likely the overflow problem is from the math.exp() function when
the temperature gets too small.
